# Index of Reference Designs

* [Breadboard-1](Breadboard-1/) PIC18F reference implementation
  designed to be used with a standard 0.1" pitch solderless breadboard.
  Most of the software was developed on this design.
* [Breadboard-2](Breadboard-2/) STM32 reference implementation
  designed to be used with a standard 0.1" pitch solderless breadboard.
  There is no software for this yet, but perhaps someday.
* [Manual-1](Manual-1/) it all started here!  A PIC18 minimal implementation
  on an 800 point bread board.  It may be possible to start with parts 
  already on hand!  The inspiration for our Breadboard-1 design above.
