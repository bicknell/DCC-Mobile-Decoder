## List of Decoder Designs

* [reference/Breadboard-1/](reference/Breadboard-1/) reference implementation 
  designed to be used with a standard 0.1" pitch solderless breadboard.

## Relevant NMRA Standards

* [NMRA Standards and Recommended Practices](https://www.nmra.org/index-nmra-standards-and-recommended-practices), in particular section 9.1 contains all of the DCC details.
* [S-9.1 Electrical Standards for Digital Command Control](https://www.nmra.org/sites/default/files/standards/sandrp/pdf/s-9.1_electrical_standards_for_digital_command_control_2021.pdf) 
  contains bit timing information and voltages.

### Reproduced NMRA Standards

Decoders must operate within the following characteristics:

| Scale       | Min V | Nomnial V | Max V | 
| -----       | ----- | --------- | ----- |
| N & Smaller | 7     | 12        | 24    |
| HO/S/O      | 7     | 15        | 27    |
| G & Larger  | 7     | 18        | 27    |
