* [Conventions](conventions/) contains documentation of hardware conventions
  used across all designs in this project.
* [Reference](reference/) designs are used to understand DCC and develop
  software.  They are generally not suitable to put in a locomotive.
* [Decoders](decoders/) are mobile decoders suitable for putting into 
  locomotives designed to work with the same general software as the 
  reference decoders.
* [KiCad Libraries](kicad_libraries/) contains a symbol and footprint
  library that contains symbols used by the project that do not come
  with the stock KiCad distribution.
