# Electrical Requirements

## Reproduced NMRA Standards

Decoders must operate within the following characteristics:

| Scale       | Min V | Nomnial V | Max V | 
| -----       | ----- | --------- | ----- |
| N & Smaller | 7     | 12        | 24    |
| HO/S/O      | 7     | 15        | 27    |
| G & Larger  | 7     | 18        | 27    |

## Project Targets

All designs in this project should target the following specifications:

| Scale       | Min V | Nomnial V | Max V | Rating | Min Amps | Nominal Amps |
| -----       | ----- | --------- | ----- | ------ | -------- | ------------ |
| N & Smaller | 6     | 12        | 24    | 30V    | 1A       | 1.5A         |
| HO/S        | 6     | 15        | 27    | 40V    | 1.5A     | 2A           |
| O           | 6     | 15        | 27    | 40V    | 2A       | 3A           |
| G & Larger  | 6     | 18        | 27    | 60V    | 3A       | 5A           |

* Min V - Minium operating voltage.
* Nominal V - Expected operating voltage.
* Max V - Maxium operating voltage.
* Rating - Minimum rating for components exposed to track voltage.
* Min Amps - Minimum motor amperage output, particularly for space constrained designs.
* Nominal Amps - Target motor amperage output for most designs.
